#   1. Session sharing disabled (OPENCODE_DISABLE_SHARE + config)
#   2. Models restricted to GitLab-approved providers (OPENCODE_MODELS_PATH)
#   3. Small model forced to gitlab/duo-chat-haiku-4-5 (config)
#   4. Model fetching from models.dev disabled (OPENCODE_DISABLE_MODELS_FETCH)
#   5. Only the "gitlab" provider is enabled (enabled_providers)
